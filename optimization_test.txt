§ Test program to demonstrate effective code optimization
Programme

DATA
§ Variable declarations
INTEGER: a | b | c | result | temp | unused;
FLOAT: f1 | f2;
CONST: PI=3;

END

CODE
§ Code with redundancies and unused variables
a = 10;
b = 20;

§ Common subexpression that should be eliminated
temp = a + b;
result = a + b;

§ Dead code elimination (unused variable)
unused = 100;

§ Algebraic simplifications
c = a * 1;        § Should optimize to c = a
result = result + 0;  § Should optimize to no-op 
f1 = b * 2;       § Should optimize to f1 = b + b
f2 = c / 1;       § Should optimize to f2 = c

§ Copy propagation
b = a;
c = b;            § Should become c = a

§ Final result display
DISPLAY("The result is: ": result);
